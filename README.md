# 3D
Collection of FDM printed parts.

If one of those parts/projects worked out for you consider donating a coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/EmilieEvans
In case there is potential for improvements feel free to open an issue. 
If you want to remix or use the part commercialy if it is under a licence which technically doesn't allow it just write me a message. Same goes for potential licence incompatibilitys. Also don't hasitate to ask if there is no solution for your probem in this collection. I might find your problem interesting and spend some time with it.

Naming convention:
xxxx-name (x = 0-9) = designs done by me
xxxxR-name (x = 0-9) = remixed (most of the work not done by me)
