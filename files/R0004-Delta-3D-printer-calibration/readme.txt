Remixed part (chirality added/axis indiacation) for the delta calibriation tool. In order to use this tool use the equations/spreadsheet provided by Salmeron Valdivieso.

To take the measurments either use a micrometer gauge or scanner (picture). Don't use a vernier (none defined compression of the path increasing inaccuarcy of the measurment).
