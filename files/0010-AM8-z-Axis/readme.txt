Replacement for Anet A8 z-Axis which obviously can also be used on the AM8 conversion. Strong points of this assambly is modularity as the endstop and drag chain mounts are replacable. 
Instead of clamping the bearing directly this design reuses the bearing blocks from the y-Axis.


Note: this part is still under development and only contains the left side at the moment.
