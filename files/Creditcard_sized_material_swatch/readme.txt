Credit card sized filament samples to create a material swatch or sample book and checking if new batches from the same brand have a identical feel and look.
The card itself has windows ranging from 0.1 mm to 0,8 mm to check for transparency/how light would shine through it (Note check your slicer. Depending on the settings the thin windows might be thicker or not printed at all) the and two small stripes (0.3 and 0.6 mm to get a rough feeling on flexibility. Overall Thickness is 1 mm.
The large part on the top is for markings. I decided to go with the following schema:
top row: Brand, material, ID (linked to a database with more information)
second row: colour (and product series), date of purchase
third row: product SKU
