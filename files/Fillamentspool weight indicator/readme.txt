Summary
This is a novel approach to add a weight indicator to filament spools decimating the need for weighing them. The best thing it can be reused: when the spool is empty remove it and clip it to the next one.

Note 1:
The small one is the zero mark and used for a quick alignment check.
The large one is the 500g mark and all are in 100g distances to each other.

Note 2: This part was tested using PLA.

Note 3: This part was developed for Eryone filament spools.

Note 4: a quick test with OWL filament spool shows that it also works on different spool types but does not fit perfectly.
Note 5: Don't buy OWL filament.

How I Designed This
Setp 1:
getting the clip to fit: not to tight , not lose


Setp 2:
Calculating the radius where each mark would go.


Setp. 3:
adding the calculated values to the drawing
