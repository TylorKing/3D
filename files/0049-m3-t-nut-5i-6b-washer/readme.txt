Generic designs use an m3 nut which gets pulled against printed plastic and then makes contact with the aluminum profile. The weak point of this construction is the printed plastic part (see picture, PETG, 100% infill).

In contrast, this design overcomes these issues and enable higher mounting forces for a sturdier connection by incorporating a washer.

This is accomplished by reducing the functionality of the weak printed part by aligning  m3 washer (DIN 9021), m3 nut (DIN 934), and middle of the extrusion prior to mounting and preventing the nut from rotation (torsion). These changes result in metal-to-metal contact and higher torques/forces tolerances as the plastic part just stops the rotation of the nut during assembly.

Note: This is drawn for Item profile nut-5 profiles but should also work flawlessly for Bosch nut 6 (what most printer frames use).
Note: In case of failure the connection stays like it is but can't be removed/unfastened unless an appropriate tool/technic is used. Normally the M3 thread of the screw/nuts fails first.
