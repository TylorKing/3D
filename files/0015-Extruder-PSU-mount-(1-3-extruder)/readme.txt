Allows to mount the extruder on a standard powersupply (e.g. those found on Anycubic Kossel).
Also included are variants for dual and tripple extruder setups. 
This design is compatible with most extruder constructions. In particular with BMG  and MK8 (Creality & Anycubic).

Note: Only the dual and single extruder is tested.

How I Designed This

-3: flipped mount


-4: dual extruder mount


-5: tripple extruder mount


-6: hole instead of a slot for the second screw to reinforce this point as it is a potential point of failure
