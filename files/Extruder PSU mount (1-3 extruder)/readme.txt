Allows to mount the extruder on a standard powersupply.
Also included are variants for dual and tripple extruder setups. While the dual extruder version should work fine. The tripple extruder version could fail given the lever length and total load/combined stepper motor weights (dual & triple version untested).

How I Designed This

-3: flipped mount


-4: dual extruder mount


-5: tripple extruder mount


-6: hole instead of a slot for the second screw to reinforce this point as it is a potential point of failure
