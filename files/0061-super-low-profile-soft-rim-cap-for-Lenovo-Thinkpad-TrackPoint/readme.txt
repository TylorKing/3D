Post-Printing

How I Designed This
Measurements where taken with a microscope on the inside and caliper.

After test printing the first version the dot count was reduced to five to ensure it would print and cutout was widened a tiny bit. With higher dots counts it result in rings rater then dots.


Related to this is part 060 which is the low profile version found on newer Thinkpads.
