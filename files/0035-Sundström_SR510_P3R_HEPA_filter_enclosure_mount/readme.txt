Summary
Evaluate this design yourself as it is provided as it without any guarantee it will work.

Simple mount which allows mounting a Sundstr√∂m SR-510 P3R HEPA filter to cabinets or enclosures to clean the exhaust or intake air.
The seal/minimising leakage is realised by two mechanism:

thread blocking most of the air
lid pressing onto the rubber grommet of the filter
Combined with the relatively low filter resistance this should yield a low enough leakage for most applications.
