Generic designs use a m3 nut which get's pulled against printed plastic which then makes contact to the aluminium profile. The weak point of this construction is the printed plastic part (see picture, PETG, 100% infill).

In contrast this designs overcomes this issues and enables higher mounting forces for a sturdier connection by incorporating a washer.

This is accomplished by reducing the functionality of the weak printed part to aligning  m3 washer (DIN 9021), m3 nut (DIN 934) and middle of the extrusion prior to mounting and preventing the nut from rotation (torsion).These changes resulting in metal to metal contact and higher torques/forces tolerances as the plastic part just stops the rotation of the nut during assembly.

Note: This is drawn for Item profile nut-5 profiles but should also work flawlessly for Bosch nut 6 (what most printer frames use).
Note: In case of failure the connection stays like it is but can't be removed/unfastened unless a appropriate tool/technic is used.
