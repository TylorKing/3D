Summary
Replacement/upgrade for the cap on of the TrackPoint. It mimics the soft rim design used in Dell Latitude or old IBM/Lenovo Thinkpad.
The cap itself was made for a Lenovo Thinkpad Yoga 12 which uses a low profile TrackPoint Cap. This should match with most recent ThinkPads models. I still recommend checking comparability before printing.

For best results use a 0.2 mm nozzle and low layer height. It should also print with a 0.4 mm but some details might get lost.
Ideally the material is flexible. The one used for this print is rated at shore hardness 45D.

How I Designed This
Measurements where taken with a microscope on the inside and caliper.


After test printing the first version the dot count was reduced to five to ensure it would print and cutout was widened a tiny bit. With higher dots counts it result in rings rater then dots.
