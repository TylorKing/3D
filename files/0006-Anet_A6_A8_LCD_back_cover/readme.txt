Replaces the original laser cut acrylic back of the LCD. This part doesn't need nuts and has no visible screws. The main focus was filling the gap/hiding the LCD PCB when looking from the top. Further it clearly states which cable is LCD and J3.

During slicing I deiced optics isn't that important and just used black electrical tape so this part is untested.
