Beautiful option to mount two extruder on a 2040 profile and hide the wires inside the 2040 profile.
The mounting tool isn't required but makes assambling easier as it holdes the stepper in the right height an can be left inside the enclosure for further use.

Note: spacing between the extruder isn't enough for two BMG extruder.
