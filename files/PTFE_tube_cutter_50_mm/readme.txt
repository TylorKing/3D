Jig for cutting PTFE into 50mm parts with a utilitty knife. The part accounts for the blade thickness, easy insertion of the knief (the side closer to the finger is heigher) and the shaft for the knife is deeper then the buttom of the tube to ensure a completed cut.

steps: 
1. insert a few mm
2. cut
3. push and remove the small part, now the first end is a straight
4. push the tube completly in
5. cut
6. push it in until it is flush with the front
7. chamfer
8. remove the tube

Note: for best result check after each cut that the cut was sucessfull by holding it against a straight part and checking if light is visible.
