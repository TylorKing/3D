Jig for cutting PTFE into 50mm parts with a utility knife. The part accounts for the blade thickness, easy insertion of the knife (the side closer to the finger is higher) and the shaft for the knife is deeper than the bottom of the tube to ensure a completed cut.

steps: 
1. insert a few mm
2. cut
3. push and remove the small part, now the first end is a straight
4. push the tube completely in
5. cut
6. push it in until it is flush with the front
7. chamfer
8. remove the tube

Note: for best result check after each cut that the cut was successful by holding it against a straight part and checking if the light is visible.
