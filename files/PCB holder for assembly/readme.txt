Tool to level the workpiece with the microscope. Which can be used/modified in multiple ways:

upper part: slide which is PCB specific
middle: "table" with legs and rail on the bottom and side. Can also be used directly as surface without a slide
lower: variable height standoffs to adopt the larger middle part to multiple height targets (for example when used without a slide).
